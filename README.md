## TypeDB Studio

[![TypeDB Studio](./images/studio_full_1.png)](./images/studio_full_1.png)

TypeDB Studio is TypeDB's Integrated Development Environment to perform knowledge engineering.

You can utilise Studio like [TypeDB Console](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/console/console)
and [TypeDB Clients](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/client-api/overview), to connect to your TypeDB instance and perform
queries.

Whether you need a tool to test and experiment with your newly created TypeDB database, or you prefer a graphical
interface for reading data from TypeDB, Studio is a powerful tool to help you accomplish your task. 

## Download & Install
TypeDB Studio is available for Linux, Mac and Windows. Head over to the 
[releases](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-studio/releases) page to download and install the latest release of Studio.

## Usage
Usage is easy! After you [install](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb-studio/releases) the appropriate distribution,
just enter the address, select your database and start writing queries.

### Graph Visualisation
[![Graph Visualisation](./images/graph_vis_1.png)](./images/graph_vis_1.png)
Reasoning about text outputs in [TypeDB Console](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/console/console) or through
the various [TypeDB Clients](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/client-api/overview) can be difficult to do for large
datasets. Studio's graph visualisation makes the underlying structure of data immediately apparent. Studio's intuitive
and self-explanatory interface also allows for rapid iteration of queries.

### Reasoning and Explanations

Select infer and explain, then double-click highlighted inferred concepts to retrieve their explanations and visualise
how the fact was inferred.

### Log Output

Log output behaviour you might be familiar with from [TypeDB Console](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/console/console) is 
available to you within Studio as well. Searching for and understanding your data within TypeDB has never been easier.

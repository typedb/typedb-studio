## TypeDB Studio

[![TypeDB Studio](./images/studio_full_1.png)](./images/studio_full_1.png)

TypeDB Studio is TypeDB's Integrated Development Environment to perform knowledge engineering.

You can utilise Studio like [TypeDB Console](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/console/console)
and [TypeDB Clients](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/client-api/overview), to connect to your TypeDB instance and perform
queries.

Studio is an IDE designed for the end-to-end development of TypeDB databases, database queries, and data exploration, 
via a clean and intuitive UI.

## Usage

Upon launching Studio, you'll be asked for your TypeDB server details and to choose or create a database. Studio makes
these choices explicit so that it's always clear what you're working on at any given time.

### Manage TypeDB Projects

After connecting to TypeDB and selecting a database, Studio will prompt you to open (or create) a project directory. 
This is where Studio will load and save query files, but we can also freely edit text files in the project directory 
using Studio. The project browser maintains a live view of the directory contents on the filesystem.

### Manage Database Schemas

The Type Browser provides a structured tree view of the connected database's type hierarchy. Opening any Type will 
bring up a page that lists in detail its properties - supertype, roles played, attributes owned, etc.

### Run TypeQL Queries

Studio's text editor comes equipped with rich developer tooling, like syntax highlighting
for TypeQL files (\*.tql), with more advanced features currently under development. Studio's intuitive and 
self-explanatory interface enables a rapid, iterative workflow.

TypeDB Studio brings session and transaction configuration to the forefront, providing greater visibility to the user 
about the state of the system. Studio allows you to run any TypeQL query, pretty-printing results
to the Log Output window which is easily searchable (and supports regex matching.)

### Graph Visualisation

Reasoning about text outputs in [TypeDB Console](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/console/console) or through
the various [TypeDB Clients](https://docs.vaticle.com/docs/client-api/overview) can be difficult to do for large
datasets. Studio's advanced force-graph visualisation makes the underlying structure of data immediately apparent.

### Reasoning and Explanations

Select infer and explain, then double-click highlighted inferred concepts to retrieve their explanations and visualise
how the fact was inferred.

## Compiling and Running TypeDB Studio from Source

> Note: You **DO NOT NEED** to compile TypeDB Studio _"from source code"_ if you just want to use TypeDB Studio. You can simply download TypeDB Studio following section above.

1. Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:
    - Java JDK 11 or higher
    - [Bazel 5 or higher](http://bazel.build/). We use [Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) to manage multiple Bazel versions transparently. Bazelisk runs the appropriate Bazel version for any `bazel` command as specified in [`.bazelversion`](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb/blob/master/.bazelversion) file. In order to install it, follow the platform-specific guide:
      - MacOS: `brew install bazelbuild/tap/bazelisk`
      - Linux: `wget https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/download/v1.4.0/bazelisk-linux-amd64 -O /usr/local/bin/bazel`

2. Depending on your Operating System, you can compile and run TypeDB Studio with either one of the following commands.
   ```sh
   $ bazel run //:studio-bin-mac
   ```
   ```sh
   $ bazel run //:studio-bin-windows
   ```
   ```sh
   $ bazel run //:studio-bin-linux
   ```
   You can also replace `run` with `build` in the command above, and Bazel will simply produce the JAR for TypeDB Studio under `bazel-bin/studio-bin-<mac|windows|linux>.jar`.

## Contributions

TypeDB Studio has been built using various open-source frameworks throughout its evolution. Today TypeDB Studio is built using [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), [Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb), and [Bazel](https://bazel.build). Thank you!

TypeDB Studio is TypeDB's Integrated Development Environment to perform knowledge engineering.

You can utilise Studio like [TypeDB Console](http://docs.vaticle.com/docs/running-typedb/console)
and [TypeDB Clients](http://docs.vaticle.com/docs/client-api/overview), to connect to your TypeDB instance and perform
queries.

Whether you need a tool to test and experiment with your newly created TypeDB database, or you prefer a graphical
interface for reading data from TypeDB, you will find Studio extremely useful.

## Usage

Usage is easy! After you install the appropriate distribution, just enter the address, select your database and
start writing queries.

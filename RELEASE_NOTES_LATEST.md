## New Features


## Bugs Fixed
- **Fix printing of variables with empty values and rows with no columns**
  Enhance printing logic to handle two special cases of received answers:
  * When a variable with no values is returned, an empty result will be shown instead of a crash (it used to be considered an impossible situation).
  * When concept rows are returned, but they do not have any columns inside (possible for delete stages), a special message is written for every row processed (this behavior is temporarily different from Console).

/**
 * Some of these tests use delay!
 *
 * The rationale for this is that substituting in stub classes/methods would create a lot of friction from release to
 * release as the tests would require updating to completely reflect all the internal state that changes with each
 * function. As a heavily state-driven application, duplicating all of this functionality and accurately verifying that
 * the duplicate is like-for-like is out of scope.
 *
 * The delays are:
 *  - used only when necessary (some data is travelling between the test and TypeDB)
 *  - generous with the amount of time for the required action.
 *
 * However, this is a source of non-determinism and a better and easier way may emerge.
